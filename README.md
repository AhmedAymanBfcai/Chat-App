# Node-Chat-App

This is a simple Chat App using NodeJs, You can see live demo here : https://geek-chat-app.herokuapp.com/

The project was created using Node js with WebSockets and Socket.io library, It enables users to login to different chat rooms, 
send messages and their geographical location using google maps.

The project was a part of The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition) on udemy and I had learned alot wth the great Instructors Andrew Mead and Rob Percival.
